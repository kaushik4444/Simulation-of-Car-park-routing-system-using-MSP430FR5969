# Development of an algorithm to simulate a 'Car-park routing system' using MSP430FR5969 and its peripherals with minimum energy dissipation

MSP430FR5969 is an Ultra-low-power MCU launchpad. It consists of various peripherals such as LEDs, Interrupts, Timers, UART serial Communication, etc. Using these, simulated a 'Car-park routingâ€™ system with minimum energy dissipation.
